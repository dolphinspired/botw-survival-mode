# The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - "Survival Mode"

## Intent

The intent of this challenge is not necessarily to make the game harder. Rather, it aims to keep that early-game survival feel from the Plateau alive . The rules for this mode were made with the following priorities in mind:

1. Exercise game mechanics that are underused or neglected in normal gameplay
2. Add a layer of challenge _without_ adding tedium
3. Encourage planning ahead through meaningful choices and consequences

## Rules Overview

Here's a quick rundown of the rules. For edge-cases and optional rules, see the next section.

* No fast travel
* No shops - can't buy from or sell to any vendor with a "shop interface"
* Travel light - Keep your inventory limited to what Link _might_ actually be able to carry:
  * 4 melee weapons
  * 1 bow
  * 1 shield
* The Master Sword and Champions' weapons do _not_ count against these inventory limits. They're upgrades, you've earned them!
* Dress for the occasion - you can only change armor while in a town or stable (near a "wardrobe")
* Paleo diet to-go - any food prepared at a cooking pot must be eaten before leaving, but grilled food can travel with you
* Protein shakes to-go - you can hold one elixir per Great Fairy that you've unlocked
* No eating or drinking in combat

### Travel

* No fast travel. Period!
  * You will learn to travel by horse and you will love it! Fortunately, your horse can still "fast travel" to you when it's equipped with the Ancient Saddle (DLC required), so you'll want to get this early.
  * Since Divine Beasts can only be exited or re-boarded via fast travel, you should aim to complete them in one attempt. If you get stuck (not enough weapons, food, or buffs to complete), reload a save from before attempting the Divine Beast and try again. Or, if that fails, simply fast-travel
